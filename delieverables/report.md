# Coursework on Deep Learning and Robotics
- author: Eu-Bin KIM (10327741)


## Introduction (3)

A clear introductory to the problem and the methodology to be used, with justification of the network topology and hyperparameters chosen (3)

What are we doing here?
- CIFAR dataset
- with a CNN
- justification - summarize them here. (judging from the results... of course.)


## Literature review (8)

Contextualisation and state of the art in robotics and deep learning (marks given for
clarity/completeness of the overview of the state of the art, with spectrum of deep learning
methods considered in robotics; critical analysis of the deep learning role in robotics; quality
of the references cited)


> basically answer the question : what's the role of deep learning in cognitive robotics?
- run a critical analysis
- pros? and cons?
- must provide examples.
- do provide references





## Methods (7)

Complexity of the network(s), hyperparameters and dataset (marks given for complexity
and appropriateness of the network topology; hyperparameter exploration approach; data
processing and coding requirements)



> just state the


## Description  (12)

- justification goes here.


Description, interpretation and assessment of the results on the hyperparameter testing
simulations, including appropriate figures and tables to support the results (marks given for
the clarity of the reporting of the simulations done and the results presented via
text/tables/charts; Depth of the interpretation and assessment of the quality of the results;
Discussion of alternative/future simulations to complement the results obtained); Marks
lost if report longer than the required maximum of 5 pages.

> Include a discussion - how could you improve upon what you currently have?
